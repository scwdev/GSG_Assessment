I made two specific choices, one of which I feel is a little questionable:

    1) Regarding age I gave responses a +/- 1 year margin for error, given that getting age by subtracting birth year form "current" year will be off depending on birthday.
        - worth mentioning, I considered giving an even greater margin for error to account for the fact that people frequently lie about their age. Ultimately decided it wasn't worth it for the excercise.

    2) Regarding sex/gender identification, I took the most direct path, where a match meanth a positive result, a binary sex/gender mismatch meant a negative result, and "non-binary", "other", and "refused" were left positive. I personally feel like this is probably a bad methodolgy, but without more data it's difficult to make more informed decisions. For example this method does not account for gender-fluid respondents who might give different answers at different times. In addition, no allowances are made for respondents who have undergone sex-reassignment surgery. So I'm not thrilled with my solution, but it's functional.
        - if I were to start over I might choose to just ignore the Sex/Gender match field entirely. Need more research.
