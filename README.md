## GSG Assessment, Nov-19-2021

### Approach
While I felt quite comfortable with the Python side of things, my experience working with .csv files or any dataset that I didn't build myself is limited. I have mixture of pandas and SQL knowledge, which is why the answers to some of the questions appear to be a Frankenstein's Monster made of both.

### Takeaways
I had such a blast and learned a whole lot. More than anything I think I lean a little too much on SQLAlchemy without the grounding I'd like to have with SQL query syntax. For the most part I think all the output .csv files are as requested. The exception is Q3, which is missing parameter #2.c. I tried to address it with my initial SQL query (./question_3/app.py lines 26-29), but just couldn't get the ding-dang thing to work!

I most enjoyed building out the models for Q4 (though in retrospect I could have saved myself some work there), and thinking about the match constraints of Q1b. The puzzle of representing messy humans as clean data is an impossible and engaging one; accurate, inclusive representation is so rewarding to think about.

This was a deep dive into a subject not really covered in my bootcamp, and I was delighted by the challenge.
